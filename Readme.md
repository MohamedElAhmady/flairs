# Spring boot app container connected to postgres database container

- This was the first time to work with docker.
- I'm not very sure that what I've done in the docker part is what is really required.
- But what I did is to run the docker container for db and make sure it is running.
- It will work perfectly.
- I used Spring data for accessing the database.
